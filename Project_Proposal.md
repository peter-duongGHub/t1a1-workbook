    - Website layout, design and creation using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and other necessary technologies/tools
    - Website testing of functionality, performance and compatibility on different devices
    - Alex's subsequent feedback during development stages
    - Iterations implemented in development depending on Alex's feedback
    - End Approval of development

    The project will begin on March 20th 2024 and is estimated to be completed by June 20th 2024. Peter's Software Development will entail a detailed project timeline, including milestones and deadlines during each stage.  

4. ### Deliverables  
    - Designing website and arranging its layout  
    - Creating content and designing  
    - Applying Functionality to website  
    - Additional features (specified if any)      

5. ### Technical Requirements  
    The technical requirements for SAM website development include:    

    ### Technology/Tools:  
    #### HTML  
    - A markup language that I will be using to structure your website content. It will assist me in creating and linking all your pages, navigation menu, text content, header, footer, body and graphical components containing interesting facts and images about artefacts, objects, paraphernalia and some animations to help with user experience.  

    #### CSS  
    - This stylesheet language will help engage your visitors and contrast each element on your website via styling of HTML elements. Styling will include changes to background colours, font colours, typography, aligning of elements and responsive design relating to varying screen sizes on different devices, CSS will be used for many more styling purposes I've just named a few to help you understand a little better.  

    #### JavaScript  
    - JavaScript will be used front-end as a programming language. It will facilitate dynamic properties for your website and implements interactivity for your website, keeping your users engaged, entertained and happy. I will be using this for content such as form submissions and buttons to name a few.  

    ### Time Management and Scheduling  
    #### Trello  
    - To provide transparency and ensure proper time management we will use Trello boards to keep track of our progress and complete objectives before deadlines.  

    ### Design Tools/Mockup
    #### Wireframes  
    - I will be applying low-fidelity wireframes to help with the initial stages of the design process to ensure we are heading in the right direction in alignment with your needs. This will be a rough sketch of how the website will be structured and where elements will be arranged accounting for a responsive design as well (varying screen sizes will have differing associated sketches to convey responsiveness).  

    #### Sitemaps  
    - Sitemaps will be included within a readme documentation file to provide you with assistance in understanding how pages are linked and how each page will be navigated.    

    ### Source Control  
    #### GitHub  
    - GitHub will be used to help with collaborations, identifying bugs and to implement, track and/or store file or folder changes. For example, if you ever feel the need to onboard other website developers this would be a necessary step to help them continue or discuss iterations with the current files.  

    #### Source Code  
    - Source coding will be written within VisualStudioCode to help centralise management and organisation of your HTML, CSS & JavaScript files. 

    #### Documentation  
    - I will add a readme document file using VisualStudioCode with technical instructions customised for your understanding on how your website is navigated, its components (diagrams and examples), how you interact with different elements (including screenshots) and troubleshooting issues.  

    #### Terminal  
    - Ubuntu will be used to help migrate source code from local repositories to a remote repository such as GitHub.  

    #### Deployment/Hosting    
    - This will essentially involve hosting your website on a web application such as Netlify so it may be visible to everyone.    


6. ### Intellectual Property Rights  
    Upon all fees payed with the completion of the website project, Peter's Software Development will transfer all rights, titles and interests. This includes all source code, mockups, designs, documentation and content transferred to Alex. Peter's Software Development retains the right to use the created website as marketing content and personal display.

7. ### Confidentiality
