## Q1 
### Identify
#### What is Web Development Markup Language?
Web Development Markup Language is one of many languages in web development used to structurally present text, images and/or links in a web document, it enables the previously mentioned content to be rendered in a specified way. <!-- Web Development Markup Language also allows annotating comments which will not render but is useful for any viewer to further understand the structure/meaning of a web document or intention of the web developer who created the web document. -->

### Explain 
#### How does Web Development Markup Language work?
Web Development Markup Language uses either tags or code around or between text, providing instructions to a computer on how certain elements should be displayed & structured on a web document. Text, tags and code may be written in a simple text editor such as notepad, microsoft word, visual studio code to name a few, and converted into a web development markup language format before rendering on a web page. Each markup language has certain rules to distinguish between text and the tags or codes necessary to implement web document structuring, this is called syntax. The web development markup language is parsed by a web browser.


#### Example Web Development Markup Language
- HTML5
- XHTML
- XML
- LateX

Why is markup language important?

Components and concepts of markup languages

## Q2 
What are packets?/ip/routers/domains and dns
### What are Packets
Packets also known as datagrams are fixed data units that are transmitted from one computer to another over an interconnected network. Packets are components broken down into fixed sizes, (such as images or text) when all packets are received at the destination IP address, packets are reassembled into the whole data component. Packets travel through layer 3 devices. The network protocol that is used will determine the components of each packet.  

### How do Packets work?
A TCP packet such as ACK packet confirms receiving packets and relays a signal back to the sender for continued packet transmission. 


### Why are they important
Packets are important as they help with the efficiency of transferring data. Without packets data would be transferred in large bits, if more than two computers are involved the other computers wont be able to access the data simultaneously.

### Components of Packets
Each packet is made up of:
**Header**  
The header is composed of:
- Version Number
- Header Length
- Differentiated services
- Datagram/Packet length
- Option field
#### Version Number
Helps Datagram be processed by internet protocol software in machine. 

#### Header Length
Each word is 4 bytes in length in IPv4.

#### Option Field
The option field allows Ipv4 header length to range from 20 - 60 bytes. The value in option field also determines the header length of the IPv4 datagram/packet.

#### Differentiated Services
Made up of:
- DSCP 
- ECN explicit congestion notification
Differentiated services of the datagram is composed of 2^6 bit combinations classify IP packets to facilitate the prioritising of different ip packets, giving precendence for those that are more important.

- Data 
- Footer
#### Header
The header is made up of the ip address of both the destination and source address which helps direct the packet to the correct computer in an efficient manner. 

#### IPv4 IPv6
**Ipv4** addresses are composed of 32 bit length ip addresses. They consist of 4 numbers seperated by a dot, each number may be a value between 0 and 255. Machines will convert this number into binary for rendering and understandability. The total number of devices 2^32 devices can be given an IPv4 Ip address. 

#### Complications of IPv4
With the limited number of devices IPv4 can allocate an ip address to, the move to IPv6 is happening. 

#### IPv6
**IPv6** addresses are composed of 128 bit length ip addresse. They consist of 
IPv6 will allocated 2^128 Ip addresses for each device. 


#### IP addresses
- Static IP Address
- Dynamic Ip Address

#### IPv4 Addresses
- Made up of Network Id and Host Id
- Made up of 32 bits (Ipv4)
- How IP address is divided into network id and host id is depending on the class the ip address is
- Loopback address 127
- Ipv4 classes:
A, B, C, D, E

#### Class A
- Network Id portion of Ip address takes up 8 bits. Host Id takes up 2^24 

#### Static Ip Address
Are used for DNS servers and are permanent addresses.


#### Dynamic Ip Address
Changes every time you access the internet. Such as your ISP providing internet to your computer. They provide an ip address within a certain range.



while Ipv6 addresses are composed of 128 bit

#### IPv4 Datagrams/Packets Format



#### Data
The data is made up of whichever data type is being transmitted. E.g Image, Text etc.

#### Footer
The footer/trailer role is to detect any errors with the packet also called EDC (error detection code).

## Q3 
What are TCP?/ HTTPS and HTTP ? Web Browsers
### What is TCP?
TCP stands for transmission control protocol. TCP helps in ensuring all packets are delivered to destination ip address.
