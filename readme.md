#### How does Web Development Markup Language work?
Web Development Markup Language uses either tags or code providing instructions to a computer on how certain elements should be displayed & structured on a web document. Tags and code may be written in a simple text editor such as notepad, microsoft word, visual studio code to name a few, and converted into a web development markup language format before rendering on a web page. Each markup language has certain rules to distinguish between text and the tags or codes necessary to implement web document structuring, this is called syntax. The web development markup language is parsed onto a web browser.
