#T1A1 - Workbook

##Q1 - Identify and explain common and important components and concepts of web development markup languages.

There are many elements and components that make up web development from HTML/CSS/XML to name some of the components, below is a brief breakdown of the three most popular and readily utilized components, these form the foundation of web development, thus enabling developers to create styled/structured content with semantics for enhanced content for search engines.

###HTML
Hypertext Markup Language is widely utilised when developing documents for web sites and web pages, it is a mark up language which describes the web pages structure, functionality and content. Made of up elements/attributes/tags/semantics, these elements instruct the browser on how to display its content. Also gives web crawlers valuable information about what is stored on the pages for better indexing and sorting. HTML is the building block of all web pages it also enables the designer to embed images, forms and programs such as JavaScript within its code for better user engagement and experience.

###CSS
Cascading Style Sheets are greatly utilised when developing web sites, style sheets give the developer great control over the whole look and feel of the web site, by giving them the ability to make changes with very little change being made to the html code of a web site. Style sheets enable the developer to make a variety of changes which drastically enhances and changes the look and feel of a website without touching the html code and functionality of the website.

###XML
Extensible Markup Language is a rule orientated markup language, used mostly to define and store data, unlike other programming languages XML can not perform operations alone, it must be coupled with other software to implement the data management. Like HTML it also uses elements/attributes but its efficiency is benefited when search engines can more accurately categorise pages search results and interpret natural language efficiently.

Above is the brief overview of markup languages, but there are many elements and factions of web development, below are more, important factors of web development;

###Front End Development/Web Performance Optimization/Web Accessibility 
Developers responsible for front end development are tasked with the overall look, design and feel of the web site, the structural layout, templates, dynamic behavior and interactivity. Basically the entire user experience and interface.

###Back End Development/Databases/Security
Back end developers have the main responsibility of coding, hosting, data exchange and integration. Storing of data and managing data. Implementation of back-end frameworks and security authentication and data protection.

This list is not an exhaustive list but a brief overview of requirements for web development and its stages.

##Q2 - Define the features of the following technologies that are essential in terms of the development of the internet:
 - packets
 - IP addresses (IPv4 and IPv6)
 - routers and routing
 - domains and DNS

Explain how each technology has contributed to the development of the internet.

##Q3 - Define the features of the following technologies that are essential in terms of the development of the internet:
 - TCP
 - HTTP and HTTPS
 - web browsers (requests, rendering and developer tools)

Explain how each technology has contributed to the development of client and server communication over the internet (50 - 150 words for each technology)

##Q4 - Describe the features of interpreters and compilers and how they are different.
Both Compiler and Interpreter convert source code into machine code (high-level language)

Compilers and interpreters are two language types which have a critical role in software development. Their features and differences are quite profound considering they effectively do the same thing, while an interpreter executes code immediately without compilation, a compiler must translate code into an intermediate form to complete the compilation.

Also take into account that a compiler requires the entire program and requires a lot of time to process and analyze the code, whereas an interpreter takes but a single line of code to analyze, therefore is much faster and takes less time to evaluate. However, interpreted code runs slower than compiled code, because compiled code displays its errors *after* its run the compilation, whereas interpreters display their errors line by line of evaluated code.

##Q5 - Identify TWO commonly used programming languages and explain the benefits and drawbacks of each.

Two most widely sort after programming languages in the industry are JavaScript and Python, these two coding languages are currently in high demand in the industry.

Python has many benefits it is classed as a "high level general purpose programming language that supports multiple programming paradigms (including structured, object-oriented, and function)." 

Because of Pythons easy language syntax, it is the easiest programming language for beginners. It has numerous benefits, such as
- easily readable, and easy to learn
- its free to use
- compatible with Windows, Linux and Mac
- wide range of libraries
- can be integrated with other languages
- step by step debugging process
- dynamic coding
- great memory management

Its drawbacks however, not deal breakers but need to be addressed;
- it is much slower that C or C++
- not great at mobile app development
- huge memory consumption
- underdeveloped database layer
- error testing can be complex


Javascript is also a "high level, multi-paradigm, object-oriented programming language which follows ECMAScript protocols."

Its numerous benefits;
- used to develop client web apps
- used to develop serve web apps
- gaming apps
- mobile apps
- web development
- desktop apps
- digital art
- large support community
- consistency across all browsers

Its drawbacks however;
- slow render with HTMl
- small errors can stop entire website rendering
- difficulty creating large applications
- your code is accessible and visible to everyone
- each web browser interprets the code differently and can become difficult.

All in all each program's benefits outweigh the negatives.

##Q6 - client Email

Dear Alex,

Thank you for your email enquiry regarding our Web Development Services, we would be honored to help design and create a Web Site for the Super Awesome Museum (SAM).

From the provided information in your email I would suggest the website design to have a Gallery feel, this layout will enable you to showcase all current exhibits and upcoming exhibits, The Gallery will have images of all your artifacts, objects and paraphernalia listed with a description and content of each listed item. You will be able to update the main landing home page with each new exhibit you wish to showcase to engage people to attend the museum, and generate interest. 

I would also suggest linking your social media links so people can reach out and engage with SAM over social media, you can also keep people engaged and promote your Museum through these avenues, and generate awareness. If you don't already have these set up we can help you with that also.

With regards to contacting SAM, we can design a website page with all the SAM contact details, we can also incorporate a contact form, so you can receive an email from people with written enquiries, so you can reply directly to your clientele.  We would also incorporate on the contact page the address details with a link to a map so people can easily plot the co-ordinates through google maps to find their way to SAM.

You may want to look down the track in incorporating an email subscription form so you can capture and retain a contact database, the will be useful so you can email people directly when new exhibits are coming out so people are aware of changes in your displays and artifacts, which will generate repeat visitors.

I hope my proposed layout is easy to understand, any further information you require or even a further detailed description, please don't hesitate to contact me either by phone 0400 123 456 or via email info@webdevelopment.com.au

I look forward to hearing from you to discuss the proposed website.

Kindest regards

##Q7 - Think back to a scenario or situation in your own software development projects or work.
Explain how you would do things differently if you had a chance to go through that scenario again, using an appropriate reflective cycle or reflection technique.

##Q8 - Create and Action Plan that Identifies relevant networking opportunities 

##Q9 - Explain the uses of language-learning model technologies (such as ChatGPT) on written and technical works, such as reports and software projects.

The use of language-learning model technologies like ChapGPt can be use to enhance content generation, such as reports, articles, and documents, enhancing content can save the report writer time and reduce repetition. These technologies can assist a writer by suggesting sentences, changing phrases and give improved ideas for writing efficiency and better word quality. The language-learning models can assist with editing, proofreading, give proper grammar and better syntax, by spell checking and giving better clarity to paragraphs. These technologies can generate user manuals, technical documents and content. It is even useful for code generation to help developers with debugging code, and generating documentation for software projects. It's been used to summarise and suggest research topics, analyse data, and generate reports. These technologies offer significant benefits, it is important to point out that fact checking is still essential to ensure information quality and accuracy.

##Q10 - Explain the legal and ethical impacts of the usage of language-learning model technologies (such as ChatGPT) in written and technical works, such as reports and software projects.

With respect to the language-learning technology models (such as ChatGPT) the main concern is privacy, ethical consideration, and plagiarism. These programs are language-learning technology models are designed to search vast amounts of text data, there is always a potential for discovering and displaying sensitive information that has been incorporated into other text formats and or copyright text. Other issues with the mis-information can include biased opinions, misleading results, plagiarism and a vast lack of transparency on the reliability of the given information. The issue with using ChapGPT in writing reports and software project is the information given to you via ChatGPT can be both misleading and biased and is unethical to utilise this information without cleaning up the data, and establishing clear polices and protocols.
In January 2023 Professor Matt Bower ran an experiment where he asked ChatGPT to produce a summary response to an exam question that was to have APA references.  Matthew Hillier re-ran the same test on 8th February 2023 by inputting the same text question into ChatGPT only to get a similar response, Matthew Hillier goes on to explain that 5 out of the 6 APA references where fabricated, and not at all correct. see the link.
